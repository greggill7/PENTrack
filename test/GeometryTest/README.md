Geometry test
=============

This test simulates ultra-cold neutrons stored in a cubic shell partially filled with solids that switch material at t = 5s.

It checks if ignored solids are handled properly, especially if UCN are stored in volumes while they "vanish".
Look for exceptions or UCN running into geometry errors reported at the end of the simulation.

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
