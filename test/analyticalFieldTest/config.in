# EDMStaticB0GradZField defines a z-oriented field of strength edmB0z0 with a small gradient edmB0z0dz along z, leading to small x and y components.
# The origin and orientation of the z-axis can be adjusted with the edmB0[xyz]off parameters and a polar and azimuthal angle.
# The field is only evaluated within x/y/z min/max boundaries. If a BoundaryWidth is defined, the field will be brought smoothly to zero at these boundaries.
